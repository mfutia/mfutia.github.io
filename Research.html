        <p>My research investigates interactions among aquatic animals, focusing on trophic interactions (e.g., seasonal diet) and animal behavior (e.g., habitat selection). Ultimately, I try to further our understanding of how populations respond to environmental pressures (e.g., invasive species and climate change) so we can better conserve and restore native species.</p>

      <h2>Behavioral comparisons between stocked and naturally-produced populations of a long-lived species</h2>

      <p>Drastic declines in global fish abundance have prompted use of fish stocking programs by resource managers to avoid extirpation or reestablish lost populations. However, fish responses to hatchery conditions can be highly plastic, and may result in behaviors and morphologies that are well suited for hatchery conditions but unfavorable in the wild. Many studies have described differences in juvenile fish development and behavior that are associated with hatchery rearing and impair post-release fitness (e.g., increased aggression and poor predator avoidance). Few studies, however, have compared behaviors between stocked and naturally-produced (hereafter referred to as wild) fish as adults. My research addresses this knowledge gap by comparing feeding behaviors (e.g., diet composition from stomach content and fatty acid analyses) and movement behaviors (e.g., seasonal habitat selection using acoustic telmetry) of stocked and wild adult lake trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>) in Lake Champlain.</p>

      <h2>Understanding natural recovery from a global vitamin deficiency</h2>
      <div>

      <p>Many aquatic organisms around the globe are experiencing a naturally-occuring thiamin (vitamin b1) deficiency. For fishes, this deficiency is typically seen in salmon and trout species and is related to the prey the consume. Most vertebrates are unable to produce thiamin on their own and therefore need to obtain it from their surroundings. When individuals are low in thiamin but still able to reproduce, their offspring will also be deficient and can experience various behavioral and developmental defects that can ultimately lead to mortality. In the Laurentian Great Lakes region, this deficiency is known as Thiamin Deficiency Complex and has been occuring since the 1960s resulting in reduced natural recruitment, potentially limiting the restoration of native lake trout. Hatcheries have been treating broodstock and offspring with thiamin to restore their health and maximize survival rates. I'm part of an ongoing project that is investigating if offspring in the wild can similarly replenish thiamin from ambient sources (e.g., dissolved and in prey). Most research on TDC has been done under lab settings, but our research is the first to investigate thiamin acquisition under natural conditions and the potential for offspring to recover from TDC on their own.</p>

      <h2>MS research on Thiamin Deficiency Complex</h2>
      <div>

      <p>During my time at SUNY Brockport, I had the opportunity to study fish populations from various systems including the New York Finger Lakes and Laurentian Great Lakes. However, my thesis mainly focused on a naturally occurring vitamin B1 (thiamin) deficiency - Thiamin Deficiency Complex (TDC) - in Lake Ontario. Thiamin deficiencies have been observed around the globe including animals in the Baltic Sea region and Pacific Ocean, but many questions remain about the extent and cause of the deficiency in many of these systems. In the Great Lakes, TDC has been associated with alewife (<i>Alosa pseudoharengus</i>) consumption and likley limits natural recruitment by increasing offspring mortality. My research evaluated the susceptibility and extent of the deficiency for salmon and trout species in Lake Ontario, and compared thiamin concentrations with diet patterns obtained using fatty acid analyses. By rearing offspring from each species and comparing mortality rates to thiamin concentrations, we determined which species were most susceptible to TDC and the likely extent of the deficiency in the wild. We also looked into lipid peroxidation as a potential cause of TDC based on a hypothesis from the Baltic Sea region, but found minimal evidence.</p>
